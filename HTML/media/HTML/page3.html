As a child, Murdock felt immense guilt and loss: blaming himself for the death of his father as well as feeling lost after losing his sight. He was both heroic and selfless even as a child, as was shown best when he saved an elderly man from being hit by a truck, at the cost of his own vision. Murdock has paternal issues with both his actual father Jack Murdock and his subsequent father figure Stick, having lost both either to death or from being abandoned. Stick tried to raise him to be cold-blooded but suddenly abandoned him when Matt started expressing filial affection; this abandonment and rejection has left Murdock with difficulty forging real emotional connections, despite his determination to not let Stick define him. Though it is evident that by the time of meeting the rest of the Defenders that he was starting to open up and accept help from others.

	Nelson is witty, fun-loving, and sociable, yet intelligent and professional when the situation demands it. Matt Murdock and Nelson have been best friends since college. Murdock appreciates that Nelson doesn't treat him like he's fragile and Nelson appreciates Murdock seeing him as an equal and hearing about the beautiful women entangled in Murdock's love life. The two friends were determined to start their own law firm and make a difference in Hell's Kitchen. Nevertheless, Nelson is the more pragmatic of the duo and thinks that they should take cases that actually pays the bills while Murdock wants to take cases that defend only the innocent.
Nelson disapproves of Daredevil's vigilantism and thinks that justice should be done in court. Ultimately though, Nelson's priority is whatever is best for the people of Hell's Kitchen, to the point where he gave Murdock his Daredevil suit so that he could save the city once again

	Karen Page is a cunning, optimistic woman with a humorous nature and an unshakable loyalty and love for the people closest to her. However, the series of traumatic events, from being framed for murdering her colleague at the Union Allied Construction, almost being assassinated in prison and murdering James Wesley, evolves Page into a darker and more driven character, determined to bring those that wronged her to justice. Though these personal tragedies have affected her greatly, she is first and foremost an extremely kind and caring person and doesn't allow her growing cynicism to affect her ideas or nature
Page's loyalty to her friends can make her act cold and spiteful if she feels hurt or shunned by the people she trusts. Being the only worker of Foggy Nelson and Matt Murdock who was not aware that Murdock was Daredevil, she was the only one who was constantly being lied to.  </p>

Despite being one of New York City's most powerful crime lords, Fisk has a very shy and introverted demeanor. He did not like crowds and was uncomfortable around other people, until Vanessa Marianna's involvement. Fisk almost had an compulsive mindset, being a creature of habit and hating when things in his life changed, or went against how they were planned. He preferred to operate out of the spotlight and was loathe to interact personally with his fellow conspirators unless forced to.
However, in spite of his social anxiety and his awkward nature, he is nonetheless capable of being extremely persuasive and charismatic when he needs to be. He has a keen understanding of psychology and social dynamics, which allows him to almost effortlessly manipulate people around him and exploit their psychological and emotional weaknesses.

	Benjamin Poindexter is the ultimate byproduct of a broken and dysfunctional home and childhood trauma which has rendered him a violent, unhinged, vengeful, insecure, ruthless and nearly irredeemable individual. Due to suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder, he struggled with serious issues of abandonment, which stem from neglect and loneliness at an early age. These issues made him very vulnerable and emotional and caused him to yearn to be loved by others at a very young age. However, due to his serious psychiatric issues, he struggled heavily with self-control and was prone to fits of rage, antisocial behaviour, and heinous offending. All he remembers from his parents is anger and neglect who, as they failed him for not showing and expressing to him the true love he needed and for not teaching right from wrong.

	Frank Castle is a man who has come to see the world in pure black and white terms and believes that the only way to keep the streets safe is to kill criminals so they do not harm innocents again. His sense of morality has turned to the extreme, differing greatly from what most would consider acceptable ideals of good and bad. He firmly believes that the wicked deserve to be punished and stopped permanently and that their deaths - no matter how brutal and even illegal, are needed to better the world. His military past has hardened him to even the most extensive violence, as well as his iron mentality; he claims to not suffer any PTSD for his actions as a Marine nor did he claim to feel particularly disturbed when he saw his friends die or kill for the first time. The death of his wife and children in contrast completely traumatize him with vivid night terrors and flashbacks to the night they were murdered.
