		<h3> Season 2 </h3>
	<p>  As Hell's Kitchen becomes more dangerous, new threats emerge that challenge Matt's beliefs and relationships.

The season introduces Frank Castle, aka The Punisher, a ruthless vigilante targeting criminals with lethal force. His violent methods clash with Daredevil's moral code, leading to intense confrontations and a courtroom trial where Matt and Foggy attempt to defend him.

Meanwhile, Elektra Natchios, Matt's ex-girlfriend, returns, pulling him into a war against The Hand, a secretive and deadly ninja clan, causing his relationship with Foggy and Karen to deteriorate.

 It ends with The Hand growing stronger, Elektra's apparent death (and secret resurrection), and Matt revealing his identity to Karen, setting the stage for future turmoil.</p>

		<h3> Season 3 </h3>
	<p> In Daredevil Season 3, he recovers in hiding after the events of The Defenders, questioning his faith. He believes Matt Murdock must die so Daredevil can fully take over.

Meanwhile, Fisk strikes a deal to get out of prison and manipulates the FBI from the inside. He uses Benjamin "Dex" Poindexter, a disturbed agent with deadly aim to impersonate Daredevil and ruin Matt's reputation.

Matt, working alone, uncovers Fisk's growing influence and fights to expose him. He struggles with the decision of whether or not to take Fisk for good: by taking his life.

The season ends with Matt defeating both Fisk and Dex, Fisk returning to prison under a deal to protect Karen and Foggy, and Matt embracing his identity, ready to rebuild his life.
