			<h3 style ="background-color:#80BFFF"> About Italy </h3>
			<p>Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a country in Southern and Western Europe. It consists of a peninsula that extends into the Mediterranean Sea, with the Alps on its northern land border, as well as nearly 800 islands, notably Sicily and Sardinia. Italy shares its borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, and two enclavesâ€”Vatican City and San Marino. It is the tenth-largest country in Europe by area, covering 301,340 km2 (116,350 sq mi), and the third-most populous member state of the European Union, with a population of nearly 60 million. Italy's capital and largest city is Rome; other major urban areas include Milan, Naples, Turin, Palermo, Bologna, Florence, Genoa, and Venice.  </p>
	<h3 style ="background-color:#80BFFF"> Why do I want to go there? </h3>
	<p> I want to go there because of its culture, architecture, and food. Specifically, I would love to go to museums to see sculptures and artworks from the Renaissance era (for example, the Ecstasy of St. Theresa below). We learned about some of the Renaissance art in history class, but it would be fascinating to see up close. </p>
