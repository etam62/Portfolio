		<h3 style ="background-color:#80BFFF"> About Copenhagen, Denmark </h3>
			<p>Apart from being the national capital, Copenhagen also serves as the cultural hub of Denmark and one of the major hubs in wider Scandinavia. Since the late 1990s, it has undergone a transformation from a modest Scandinavian capital into a metropolitan city of international appeal, in the same league as cities such as Barcelona and Amsterdam. This is a result of huge investments in infrastructure and culture as well as the work of successful new Danish architects, designers and chefs.Copenhagen Fashion Week takes place every year in February and August.   </p>
	<h3 style ="background-color:#80BFFF"> Why do I want to go there? </h3>
	<p> I want to go there because of the food, rich history, stunning architecture, and vibrant culture. The architecture is quite beautiful and I would love to see it in person.  </p>
